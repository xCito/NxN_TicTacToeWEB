# NxN TicTacToe


  A normal Tic Tac Toe game made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but with a twist.   
  Depending on the number of players in the game, the TicTacToe board will grow accordingly.

	p    = number of players
	size = board size (size by size)

    (2*P)-1 = size

|numPlayers | size of board | # in a rows|
|:---------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
| 2         | 3    			|     3		 |
| 3         | 5    			|     3		 |
| 4         | 7    			|     3		 |
| 5         | 9    			|     4		 |
| 6         | 11   			|     4		 |
| 7         | 13   			|     4		 |
